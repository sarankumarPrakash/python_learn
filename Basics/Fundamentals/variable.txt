Variables in Python : 

=> A variable is like a container used to store data.

=> Python is dynamically typed → you don’t need to declare the data type before assigning a value.

Example:

num = 10
print(num)


num → variable (name/container)

= → assignment operator

10 → value assigned to variable



Rules for Naming Variables:

=> Must start with a letter (a–z, A–Z) or an underscore _.

=> Cannot start with a number.

=> Can only contain letters, digits, and underscores.

=> Case-sensitive → age and Age are two different variables.

=> Avoid using Python keywords (like class, def, if, etc.) as variable names.


Examples of Valid Variables:

name = "Alice"
_age = 25
user1 = "John"

Examples of Invalid Variables:

❌ 1age = 20 (cannot start with number)
❌ user-name = "Sam" (hyphen not allowed)
❌ class = "Python" (keyword)
